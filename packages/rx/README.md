# @sern/rx
A package extending rxjs for discord api libraries 

this package offers a reactive, declarative solution using the wonderful [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) to the current collectors 
and listeners in many discord bot libraries. It's still in alpha, but most operators and functions have been tested using vitest.
